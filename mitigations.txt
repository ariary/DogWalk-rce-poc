A kind of mitigation is in place:
The webdav server is not reached when we open the .diagcab file

~> It looks like webdav is not enable yet (by default)
~> not a browser dependant issue

How to confirm that we are in this disposition?
- dir \\webdav-test.herokuapp.com@ssl\DavWWWRoot\package (in cmd) does not work
- file://///webdav-test.herokuapp.com@ssl/DavWWWRoot/package or file://webdav-test.herokuapp.com@ssl/DavWWWRoot/package/ do not work in browser (nothing is loaded)

Workaround:
In file explorer: specify path in the search bar "//", press ENTER
You will see that file://///webdav-test.herokuapp.com@ssl/DavWWWRoot/package is reachable from your browser
=> The PoC will work
